This series includes guides and examples of the processes I have used to create different content for publications, presentations, etc. A list of the different guides can be found on the left. To make navigation easy, each guide is seperated by the program that I primarily used. You can also search for content using the search bar. On the right, you will find a contents navigation. This will take you to the different sections within a guide.

## Why I am starting this series
I have spent the last three (or so) years completing a PhD in sport science. Over this time I have grown to thoroughly enjoy using various software to help me produce content that will communicate my ideas in an attractive way. Some of this involved learning to code in RStudio, but other examples include using SketchUp and Adobe Illustrator. For some, being able to use these programs may not seem like particularly special skills, but for many it seems like an enormous wall that needs to be climbed just to get started. This is how I felt before I got stuck into using them myself.  

Now that I have some experience with these programs, and now that I have finished my PhD, the idea of sharing what I have learned with others appears a very attractive proposal. To be clear, I do not consider myself to be an expert with any of the programs that I will demonstrate. I am very confident in saying that the way I have done many things throughout my PhD are not the most efficient ways of doings things. Therefore, the content I present is not necessarily best practice. What I hope is that you will get something useful out of the content that I present, something that might improve your own practices, or just something that might inspire an idea or spark a different way of thinking. 

## What inspired this series?
At some point throughout the last few years, I came across the below figure. Someone posted it somewhere (sorry, I can't remember where), and it immediately caught my attention. 
![figure](/files/figure2.jpg)
The figure actually comes from a research paper (which you can find [here](/files/figure2_paper_Cook.pdf)). As can be seen in the caption, the figure describes the movement of the front wheel of a bicycle being ghostied (pushed without anyone riding) until it falls to the ground. The symmetry of this movement is great. I like the figure so much that it is my desktop wallpaper, and I really like the idea that a research article can feature an image that is so nice it warrants being used as a wallpaper. However, what I was really interested in is **how** the authors created the figure.  

This is what has inspired this series. The main focus is to provide insight into how I have gone about creating content that I have used in my papers, presentations, posters, and so on. I am not saying that my figures are as lovely as the one featured above, but I do think the process behind creating figures is interesting. Hopefully, seeing how I have done it will help others in their own pursuits. 

## How this series will be structured
At the moment, my thinking is that each post will have two components: a written guide and a video. Hereâ€™s why. When I was going through the process of creating my own content, I used quite a range of different resources. These included YouTube videos, blogs, help files, short courses, forum posts, and so on. Sometimes a video would be most useful, sometimes it was something written. I am going to provide both in the hope that this will be of the most use for all. It is also likely that the video and the guide will have some slightly different information, so together they should be more comprehensive.  

I will aim to keep the videos reasonably concise. I found that many video tutorials would go through a lot of processes that were not necessary, or were already very well covered elsewhere. In my videos, I will aim to just go through the important information for what I did. When there are better resources available (that I know of) I will link to these instead of doubling up. Usually, this will mean my going into more detail on the aspects that I really struggled with and how I found my own solution.  

The written guides will be more of a step by step instruction, with code made available when appropriate. I have had many people provide advice to me, and I have used a lot of resources that others have made available online. I think it is important to contribute to this community by being open with the processes I have used to create my own content.
