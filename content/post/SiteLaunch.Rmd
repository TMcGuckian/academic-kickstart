# Welcome

Welcome to my personal website. At the top of the page you can navigate to different sections of the site. You can also search the site. Take a look around and get in touch if you have any questions.  

The main reason for creating this site is the [guides and videos](/courses) section. There isn't much there are the moment, but over time I will grow this into a resource that will hopefully be helpful to many. When there is a new gudie available, I will post an update too. Stay tuned!
