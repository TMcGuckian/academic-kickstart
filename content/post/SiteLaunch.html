<div id="welcome" class="section level1">
<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>Welcome to my personal website. At the top of the page you can navigate to different sections of the site. You can also search the site. Take a look around and get in touch if you have any questions.</p>
<p>The main reason for creating this site is the <a href="/courses">guides and videos</a> section. There isnâ€™t much there are the moment, but over time I will grow this into a resource that will hopefully be helpful to many. When there is a new gudie available, I will post an update too. Stay tuned!</p>
