abstract: A single subject study was completed to compare a wearable inertial sensor with first person and third person video footage, to measure the number of head turns of a participant while he explored his surroundings. Results showed that the inertial sensor was more sensitive and accurate than both types of video footage for measuring head turns. Further development of the inertial sensor for measurement of exploration behaviour is recommended, which may provide a simple tool for researchers and practitioners to measure exploration behaviours of athletes in situ.
