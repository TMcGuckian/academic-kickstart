abstract: For an athlete to prospectively control actions efficiently and effectively, they must visually perceive available affordances through visual exploratory action. This exploratory action is achieved through the movement of the eyes, head and body, however, little is known about how exploratory head movement contributes to the prospective control of action in a football context. This presentation will discuss, on an individual level, how head movement before receiving the ball contributes to the efficient completion of a subsequent pass. In doing so, findings from an experimental football passing task will be discussed to demonstrate the value of visual exploration without the ball in football. The presentation will also introduce novel approaches to the quantification and communication of visual exploratory head movement, showing the applied value of such methods for learning and performance development.
