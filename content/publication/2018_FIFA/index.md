abstract: In March 2018, the Football Technology Innovation Department attended the International Sport Engineering Association (ISEA) Conference in Brisbane, Australia. FIFA held a half-day workshop to engage with sport engineers and researchers from across the globe with the aim to strengthen ties and create new collaboration opportunities with the sports engineering community. Attendees of the workshop were given the opportunity to take part in a blog challenge with the winner getting the opportunity to have a summary of their research published on FIFA’s Innovation Blog. Each submission had to include an overview of their research accompanied by an infographic. This year’s winner is Thomas McGuckian, a PHD candidate from the School of Behavioural and Health Sciences at the Australian Catholic University in Queensland, Australia. Thomas’s blog piece on player’s situation awareness and how to use it in training beat off competition from multiple other submissions to take first prize. <p> Use the links above to find the original article and the accompanying infographic.
